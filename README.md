# NENA-Civic-Address-Extensions-2
The CLDXF-US Standard defines the United States profile of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Presence Information Data Format-Location Object (PIDF-LO) to provide a format for exchange of civic location records. Version 2 of the Standard (NENA-STA-004.2-2024) further extended the XML schema with additional NENA-specific elements. This repository hosts these additional extensions.
